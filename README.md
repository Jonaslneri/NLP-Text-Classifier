# NLP-Text-Classifier

### Scope of the project

For Kroton, customer satisfaction is always the main goal.

They have a whole area in their website, so that their 500K plus students can make comments regarding what can be improved. 

In average, they receive around 150K comments through their website. Analysing all that information was quite problematic, and done "by hand".
An analyst would have to be entirely dedicated in order to read 20% of the comments (a process that would requiere around 2~3 weeks) and label then accordingly.
After this was done, they would get the results for this subsambple and exptrapolate the results for the other 80% they couldn't read.

Now, with the NLP-Text-Classifier, they are being able to analyse 100% of all the comments coming from the students in under 60 seconds (model accuracy of ~99,67%).
